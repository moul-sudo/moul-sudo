@moul-sudo is my personal sudo mode; this account allows me to use @moul as an unprivileged user.

`beep boop`

I created @moul-sudo after reading this article: https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Infrastructure/Incident_Reports/2018-06-28_Github

Thanks to this dedicated user, itâ€™s now less a problem for me to use my personal GitHub account on a daily basis.

@moul-sudo is the best friend of @moul-bot
